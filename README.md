# Requestable #

This package allows the creation of models that can be requested. This package is used by the [socialize:friendships](https://atmospherejs.com/socialize/friendships) package to create user to user friendship requests. It could however also be useful for other models such as event listings or groups which users can request access to.

## Supporting the Project ##
In the spirit of keeping this and all of the packages in the [Socialize](https://atmospherejs.com/socialize) set alive, I ask that if you find this package useful, please donate to it's development.

## Installation ##

This package relies on the npm package `simpl-schema` so you will need to make sure it is installed as well.

```shell
$ meteor npm install --save simpl-schema
$ meteor add socialize:requestable
```

## Basic Usage ##

```javascript
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { LinkParent } from 'meteor/socialize:linkable-model';
import { Mongo } from 'meteor/mongo';
import { Request, RequestsCollection } from 'meteor/socialize:requestable';

import { GroupMember } from './GroupMember.js';

import SimpleSchema from 'simpl-schema';

const GroupsCollection = new Mongo.Collection('groups');

Request.registerRequestType('group');

class Group extends LinkParent {
    requestAccess() {
        new Request({
            ...this.getLinkObject(),
            type: 'group'
        }).save();
    }

    requests() {
        return RequestsCollection.find({
            ...this.getLinkObject(),
            type: 'group',
            deniedAt: { $exists: false },
            ignoredAt: { $exists: false }
        });
    }
}

Group.attachCollection(GroupsCollection);

Group.attachSchema(new SimpleSchema({
    name: {
        type: String,
    },
    owner: {
        type: String,
        regEx: SimpleSchema.RegEx.Id,
        autoValue() {
            if (this.isInsert) {
                return this.userId;
            }
            return undefined;
        },
    }
}));

Request.onAccepted(Group, function() {
    //`this` is the instance of the request that is being accepted
    if(this.type === 'group'){
        new GroupMember({ userId: this.requesterId }).save();
    }
});
```

> **Note**
>
> This package does not provide any allow/deny rules for requests. You will need to write your own, making sure to check the `type` field to ensure its the type of request you are expecting. Other request types should then be ignored as other packages that use this package will handle their own.

For a more in depth explanation of how to use this package see [API.md](API.md)

## Scalability - Redis Oplog ##

This package contains a preliminary implementation of [cultofcoders:redis-oplog][1]'s namespaces to provide reactive scalability as an alternative to Meteor's `livedata`. Use of redis-oplog is not required and will not engage until you install the [cultofcoders:redis-oplog][1] package and configure it.

Due to the preliminary nature of this implementation, you may run into minor issues. Please report any issues you find to GitHub so that they can be fixed.
